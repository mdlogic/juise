Building juise.deb
------------------

In order to build the debian/ubuntu .deb files, you will need to be running
under the base line version of debian that you want to support.  If you want to
build an amd64 deb file, be under an amd64 host.

Prerequisites
-------------

The prereqs for building the .deb files are:

apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake autotools-dev dh-make debhelper devscripts fakeroot xutils lintian pbuilder dpkg-dev libtool libslax0-dev uuid-dev libsqlite3-dev libssh2-1-dev uuid-dev

Building the .deb files
-----------------------

1) Update `changelog` file

Include the release notes & the proper version string in the `changelog` file
so that the debian packager can figure out the correct version name.

2) Run './debian.sh <path to lighttpd-for-juise source>'

juise requires the lighttpd-for-juise source to be downloaded to compile (due
to mod_juise needing files from there).  If you have this downloaded, specify
it to the debian.sh script.  If you do not, it will attempt to 'git clone' you
a copy and use that.

This script should take care of all the necessary steps to build and package
the .deb files.  After it is done, the files should be in the `output`
directory.

If you add any files to the distribution that need to be installed, be sure to
modify juise.install.
